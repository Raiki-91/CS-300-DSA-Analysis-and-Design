<b>What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?</b>

The problem being solved is the creation of a course planning program. The program is designed to load course data from a file, store it in a data structure, and provide various functionalities, such as listing all courses in the Computer Science department, looking up and displaying course information, and offering a user-friendly menu.

<b>How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.</b>

The approach to solving this problem involved creating a class (Course) to represent course data and using a data structure (CoursePlanner) to manage and manipulate this data. Understanding data structures was crucial in this project because they enable efficient data organization and retrieval. The CoursePlanner class used a map to store courses, which allowed for quick lookups by course number. Understanding data structures helps optimize memory usage and access times in software development.

<b>How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?</b>

Roadblocks were addressed by adding extensive debugging output to understand what was happening at various stages of the program. This helped identify issues, such as file reading problems, data loading, or course lookup failures. Troubleshooting involved looking at the code logic and making incremental changes while ensuring the correct data was loaded into the data structure.

<b>How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?</b>

This project expanded the approach to designing software by emphasizing modularity and encapsulation. The CoursePlanner class encapsulated the data and operations related to course management. It also introduced a menu system for user interaction. Modular design enables easier maintenance, testing, and future enhancements. Additionally, it reinforced the importance of data structures in efficient software design and introduced the concept of handling user input in a menu-driven program.

<b>How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?</b>

Working on this project reinforced the importance of writing clean and well-structured code. It encouraged the use of meaningful variable and method names, proper indentation, and comments to make the code more readable. The project's modularity makes it more maintainable and adaptable. By encapsulating functionality into classes and methods, changes and enhancements can be made to individual components without affecting the entire program, which makes the code easier to maintain and extend.
In summary, this project provided practical experience in designing software with an emphasis on data structures, modularity, and user interaction. It showcased the importance of debugging and testing for ensuring program reliability and correctness. The project contributed to a better understanding of writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable code.
