Vector:
Reading the File and Creating Course Objects:
Cost per line: 1 (assuming basic operations)
Number of lines executed for each course: O(n) (where n is the number of courses)
Looping through prerequisites: O(m) (where m is the number of prerequisites)
Overall complexity: O(n * m)

Hash Table:

Data Tree:
Reading the File and Creating Course Objects:
Cost per line: 1
Number of lines executed for each course: O(n)
Inserting into the tree: O(m) (where m is the number of prerequisites)
Searching in the tree: O(h) (where h is the height of the tree)
Overall complexity: O(n * (m + h))
